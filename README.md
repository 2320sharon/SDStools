# SDStools
A toolbox for analyses of Satellite Derived Shorelines (SDS) generated from CoastSeg (CoastSat)

# RoadMap 
Currently there are some post-processing needs that users of coastseg have requested. Our team has grouped these needs into five major categories.


### **Filtering**
- **Isolating Noise:** Techniques to identify and isolate noise within the shoreline data.
- **Quality:** Tools to assess the quality of the shoreline data.
- **Clouds:** Methods to deal with cloudy data segments and improve accuracy.

### **Time Series Analysis**
- **STL:** Utilize STL (Seasonal-Trend decomposition using LOESS) for shoreline time series decomposition.
- **Seasonal Shorelines:** Analyze the periodic movement of shorelines.
- **Time Series of Narrowest/Widest Beaches:** Assess the evolution of beach widths over time.

### **Comparison/Evaluation**
- **Shoreline Location from Situ Surveys (First):** Primary method for ascertaining shoreline location.
- **Shoreline Location with Lidar:** Use of Lidar data for a more granular assessment.

### **Visualization**
- **Animations:** Dynamic representation of shoreline movements.
- **Shorelines Color Coded by Time:** Visualize temporal shoreline changes with color gradients.

### **Other Analysis**
- **Beach Width Time Series (Provide Non-Erodible):** Analyze the temporal changes in beach width.
- **Non-Erodible Line for the Beach:**
- **Shoreline Position Coefficient of Variation:**
